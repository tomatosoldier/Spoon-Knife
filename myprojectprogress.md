So far I've decided to work on a puzzle game.
I am still trying to figure out the detail of the game to
make it as interesting as possible.
It is quite hard to come up with an entirely original idea to work on
since all of the ideas I've considered are derivatives of games that already exist.
Perhaps I will just take a game whose mechanics are already well known and add
on to that or mix up games that already existed as a hybrid.
Although I still wanted to think of something original for my project.
I'm considering a game that features local multiplayer option.
